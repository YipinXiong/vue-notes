## Tips Repository

### `line-height` vs `height`

If the content overflows one line in a `div`, the line-height will display two lines whose height is the value of `line-height`. While `height` only sets the `div` to single line, displaying the box-height as the value of `height` 

### display: block

use this on styling `<a>`, which will make the whole outside container tag clickable
